You are an expert instructional designer. Create a comprehensive course outline for [TOPIC] that is designed exclusively for learning through LLM conversations. The learner will ONLY interact with LLMs - no external resources, tutorials, or documentation.

## Target Audience & Outcome
- **Audience**: [Define the learner's starting knowledge level - e.g., "complete beginners with no prior experience"]
- **End Goal**: After completing this course through LLM conversations only, learners should be able to [specific, measurable outcome]

## LLM-Only Learning Requirements

### 1. Self-Contained Learning Points
- Each point must be completely explainable by an LLM in one conversation
- Include all necessary context, examples, and practice exercises within the LLM response
- No references to external documentation, websites, or tutorials
- Each point should generate a complete mini-lesson when asked to an LLM

### 2. Conversation-Ready Questions
- Format each point as a specific question the learner can copy-paste to an LLM
- Questions should prompt the LLM to provide:
  - Clear explanation with examples
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Practice exercises to try
  - Common mistakes to avoid
  - How to verify understanding

### 3. Built-in Practice & Verification
- Each point should include ways to practice within the LLM conversation
- Include self-assessment questions the learner can ask the LLM
- Provide verification methods that don't require external tools initially
- Build up to practical application gradually

### 4. Progressive Complexity for LLM Learning
- Start with conceptual understanding through LLM explanations
- Move to LLM-guided practice exercises
- Progress to LLM-assisted problem solving
- End with LLM-supported real-world application

## Structure Requirements

### 1. Bite-Sized LLM Conversations
- 80-100 individual learning points
- Each point = one focused LLM conversation (10-20 minutes)
- Each point should be specific enough to get a complete answer from an LLM
- Avoid points that would require multiple follow-up questions

### 2. Zero External Dependencies
- No "install this software" until the learner understands what they're installing
- No "go to this website" or "read this documentation"
- No "watch this video" or "take this course"
- Everything learnable through LLM conversation and explanation

### 3. LLM-Guided Hands-On Learning
- Include points for "Ask the LLM to walk you through..."
- "Request step-by-step guidance from LLM for..."
- "Have the LLM explain with examples how to..."
- "Ask the LLM to simulate/demonstrate..."

### 4. Logical Progression for Conversation Learning
- **Foundation**: Understanding concepts through LLM explanations
- **Guided Practice**: LLM walks through examples step-by-step
- **Interactive Learning**: Learner practices with LLM guidance
- **Problem Solving**: LLM helps troubleshoot and debug
- **Mastery**: LLM assists with real-world applications

## Question Format Guidelines

### Effective LLM Learning Questions
✅ **Good**: "Explain what Docker containers are, provide 3 practical examples, and walk me through creating a simple container step-by-step"

✅ **Good**: "Show me the difference between Docker images and containers with specific examples and help me understand when to use each"

✅ **Good**: "Guide me through writing my first Dockerfile step-by-step, explain each line, and help me understand what happens during the build process"

❌ **Avoid**: "Learn about Docker networking" (too vague)
❌ **Avoid**: "Read the Docker documentation" (external dependency)
❌ **Avoid**: "Install Docker and try it out" (assumes external setup)

### Question Structure Template
Each point should follow this pattern:
"[Action verb] + [specific topic] + [request for examples/guidance] + [verification method]"

Examples:
- "Explain [concept] with practical examples and walk me through [specific scenario]"
- "Show me how to [action] step-by-step and help me understand when I would use this"
- "Guide me through [process], explain potential issues, and help me verify my understanding"

## LLM Learning Path Design

### Phase Structure for LLM Learning
1. **Conceptual Foundation** (LLM explains why and what)
2. **Guided Examples** (LLM demonstrates with examples)
3. **Interactive Practice** (LLM guides through practice)
4. **Problem Resolution** (LLM helps troubleshoot)
5. **Real Application** (LLM assists with real-world use)

### Built-in Verification Through LLM
- "Ask me questions to test my understanding of..."
- "Help me identify what I might be missing about..."
- "Quiz me on the key concepts we just covered..."
- "Simulate common problems and help me solve them..."

## Content Guidelines

### LLM Conversation Optimization
- Each point should generate rich, detailed responses from LLMs
- Include requests for examples, analogies, and step-by-step breakdowns
- Ask for common pitfalls and troubleshooting guidance
- Request verification questions and self-assessment methods

### Progressive Skill Building Through LLM
- Early points: "Explain and show me examples..."
- Middle points: "Guide me through doing this myself..."
- Later points: "Help me solve this real problem..."
- Final points: "Assist me in building something complete..."

### No External Tool Dependencies Initially
- Start with pure conceptual learning through LLM
- Gradually introduce tools only when learner understands their purpose
- Provide LLM-based alternatives for initial learning
- Build up to real tool usage with full LLM support

## Validation Checklist for LLM-Only Learning
- [ ] Can each point be fully learned through one LLM conversation?
- [ ] Does each question prompt a complete, actionable response?
- [ ] Are there no external dependencies until the learner is ready?
- [ ] Can progress be verified through LLM interaction alone?
- [ ] Does each point build naturally on previous LLM conversations?
- [ ] Would a learner never feel "stuck" needing external resources?

## Output Format
Structure your response as:
- Learning objectives achievable through LLM-only interaction
- 15-25 phases designed for progressive LLM conversations
- 3-6 specific LLM questions per phase
- Each question optimized for rich, complete LLM responses
- Built-in verification and practice through LLM interaction
- No external dependencies until learner is fully prepared
