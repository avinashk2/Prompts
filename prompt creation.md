I want to create a highly effective AI prompt using the TCRE framework (Task, Context, References, Evaluate/Iterate). My goal is to [insert objective].

Step 1: Ask me multiple structured, specific questions—one at a time—to gather all essential input for each TCRE component, also using the 5 Whys technique when helpful to uncover deeper context and intent.

Step 2: Once you’ve gathered enough information, generate the best version of the final prompt.

Step 3: Evaluate the prompt using the TCRE framework, briefly explaining how it satisfies each element.

Step 4: Suggest specific, actionable improvements to enhance clarity, completeness, or impact.

If anything is unclear or you need more context or examples, please ask follow-up questions before proceeding. You may apply best practices from prompt engineering where helpful.
