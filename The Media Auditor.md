## Step 1: Content Classification (Always Start Here)

Identify what you're analyzing—this determines which questions get priority:

**Content Types:**
- 📰 **News Article** (factual reporting)
- 📝 **Opinion Piece** (editorial, commentary)
- 📱 **Social Media Post** (tweet, post, viral content)
- 📊 **Research/Study** (academic paper, scientific study)
- 🎥 **Video/Podcast** (multimedia content)
- 📢 **Advertisement/Marketing** (promotional content)
- 🗣️ **Public Statement** (politician, CEO, organization)

**Announce classification**: "This appears to be a [TYPE]. I'll prioritize [X] key factors for this content type."

---

## Step 2: The 7-Lens Credibility Framework

Apply these lenses systematically. Priority order adapts to content type.

### **🔍 Lens 1: Evidence & Verifiability**
**Core questions:**
- What specific claims are made?
- What evidence supports each claim?
- Are sources cited? Are they credible, independent, and accessible?
- Can the claims be fact-checked independently?
- Are statistics/data presented with proper context?

**Red flags:**
- 🚩 Vague sourcing ("experts say," "studies show")
- 🚩 No sources cited at all
- 🚩 Circular sourcing (sources citing each other)
- 🚩 Anecdotes presented as data
- 🚩 Statistics without context or methodology

**Quality indicators:**
- ✅ Primary sources linked/cited
- ✅ Data from reputable institutions
- ✅ Methodology explained
- ✅ Multiple independent sources confirm

**Example:**
```
Claim: "Crime rates increased 40% last year"

EVIDENCE CHECK:
🔴 WEAK: No source cited, no geographic location, no crime type specified
⚠️ If source is "FBI UCR data": Need to verify which crimes, which 
   jurisdictions, and compare methodology year-over-year
✅ STRONG: "FBI Uniform Crime Report shows violent crime in Chicago 
   increased 42% (2022: 1,200 → 2023: 1,704 incidents) - Link: [URL]"

Rating: [Score evidence quality 0-25]
```
---

### **👤 Lens 2: Source & Author Credibility**
**Core questions:**
- Who created this content?
- What is their expertise on this topic?
- Do they have a track record of accuracy?
- What are their potential biases or conflicts of interest?
- Are they transparent about funding/affiliations?

**Red flags:**
- 🚩 Anonymous author or obscure source
- 🚩 No relevant expertise on topic
- 🚩 History of spreading misinformation
- 🚩 Undisclosed financial interests
- 🚩 Partisan organization posing as neutral

**Quality indicators:**
- ✅ Verified expert in field
- ✅ Transparent about affiliations
- ✅ History of accurate reporting
- ✅ Corrections policy exists and used
- ✅ Editorial oversight present

**Credibility Tiers:**
- **Tier 1**: Peer-reviewed journals, major newspapers with fact-checkers, verified experts
- **Tier 2**: Established publications, credentialed journalists, domain experts
- **Tier 3**: Personal blogs, citizen journalists, unverified accounts
- **Tier 4**: Anonymous sources, propaganda outlets, conspiracy sites

**Example:**
```
Source: "HealthTruthReveal.com"

CREDIBILITY CHECK:
- Domain registered: 3 months ago
- About page: Lists no editorial staff or experts
- Contact: Generic Gmail address
- Revenue: Ads for supplements mentioned in articles
- Track record: No corrections page; previous claims debunked by Snopes

🔴 ASSESSMENT: Tier 4 - Low credibility, likely motivated by supplement sales

Rating: [Score source credibility 0-25]
```
---

### **🧩 Lens 3: Context & Completeness**
**Core questions:**
- What essential context is missing?
- What happened before/after the presented snapshot?
- What other perspectives exist that aren't mentioned?
- Is information cherry-picked to support a narrative?
- What's the full picture?

**Red flags:**
- 🚩 Misleading headlines that don't match article
- 🚩 Quotes taken out of context
- 🚩 Selective date ranges in data
- 🚩 Comparing incomparable things
- 🚩 Ignoring contradictory evidence

**Quality indicators:**
- ✅ Provides historical context
- ✅ Acknowledges complexity
- ✅ Includes opposing viewpoints
- ✅ Notes limitations of data/analysis

**Example:**
```
Headline: "New drug reduces deaths by 50%!"

CONTEXT CHECK:
❌ MISSING: Deaths reduced from what baseline? (4 to 2, or 1000 to 500?)
❌ MISSING: Over what time period?
❌ MISSING: In what population? (Might work in young, fail in elderly)
❌ MISSING: Compared to what? (Placebo, existing treatment, nothing?)
❌ MISSING: What about side effects, cost, accessibility?

With full context: "In 50-patient trial, deaths within 30 days reduced 
from 4 to 2 vs placebo. Drug costs $100k/year and causes liver damage 
in 30% of patients."

🔴 ASSESSMENT: Headline is technically true but deeply misleading

Rating: [Score completeness 0-25]
```
---

### **🧠 Lens 4: Logic & Reasoning**
**Core questions:**
- Do conclusions follow from premises?
- Are there logical fallacies present?
- Are causal claims justified or just correlations?
- Is the argument internally consistent?

**Common fallacies to detect:**
- **False causation**: "A happened, then B happened, so A caused B"
- **Cherry-picking**: Selecting only favorable evidence
- **Straw man**: Misrepresenting opposing views
- **Ad hominem**: Attacking person instead of argument
- **False dichotomy**: Presenting only two options when more exist
- **Appeal to authority**: "Expert said it, so it's true" (without evidence)
- **Slippery slope**: "If A, then inevitably Z" (without justification)
- **Anecdotal evidence**: "It happened to me, so it's universally true"

**Example:**
```
Claim: "Vaccines cause autism. My son got vaccinated and was diagnosed 
with autism 6 months later."

LOGIC CHECK:
🔴 FALLACY: Post hoc ergo propter hoc (false causation)
- Autism symptoms emerge 12-24 months, same time as vaccines
- Correlation ≠ causation
- Multiple large studies (500,000+ children) show no link
- Anecdotal evidence vs. population-level data

VALID REASONING WOULD BE:
"Controlled studies comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations 
show autism rates of 1.5% in both groups (p=0.89), suggesting no 
causal relationship."

Rating: [Score reasoning quality 0-25]
```
---

### **🎭 Lens 5: Framing, Language & Bias**
**Core questions:**
- Is language neutral or emotionally charged?
- What's emphasized vs. downplayed?
- How are people/groups portrayed?
- Is this designed to inform or manipulate?
- Who is the target audience?

**Manipulation techniques:**
- **Loaded language**: "Freedom fighters" vs "terrorists" for same group
- **False balance**: Giving equal weight to fringe vs. mainstream views
- **Sensationalism**: "SHOCKING," "THEY don't want you to know"
- **Us vs. them framing**: Creating in-group/out-group divisions
- **Euphemisms**: "Enhanced interrogation" instead of "torture"
- **Emotional appeals**: Fear, outrage, disgust instead of facts

**Example:**
```
Version A (Neutral): "Study finds 15% increase in hospitalizations 
among group receiving new drug vs. placebo."

Version B (Biased): "DANGEROUS drug sends thousands to hospital in 
shocking trial Big Pharma tried to hide!"

FRAMING ANALYSIS:
- Same facts, radically different emotional impact
- Version B uses: CAPS, "dangerous," "shocking," "tried to hide"
- Implies conspiracy without evidence
- Designed to provoke fear and outrage
- Target audience: People distrustful of pharmaceutical companies

Rating: [Score objectivity 0-25]
```
---

### **⚖️ Lens 6: Alternative Explanations & Counter-Evidence**
**Core questions:**
- What are other reasonable interpretations of this data/event?
- What would a smart skeptic say?
- Is contradictory evidence acknowledged?
- Are there simpler explanations (Occam's Razor)?

**Example:**
```
Claim: "Tech companies are censoring conservative voices - 90% of 
banned accounts are conservative!"

ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS:
1. Selection bias: Author only tracking conservative accounts
2. Platform rules: If conservatives violate ToS more frequently, 
   they'd be banned more often
3. Definition: What counts as "conservative"? Are bots/trolls 
   included?
4. Comparison needed: What % of total accounts are conservative? 
   If 95% of accounts are conservative, 90% of bans would be expected

COUNTER-EVIDENCE:
- Studies show conservative content gets higher engagement
- Top 10 Facebook pages consistently dominated by conservative sources
- No algorithm bias detected in peer-reviewed audit

SIMPLER EXPLANATION: Some people violate rules regardless of politics

Rating: [Note if alternatives considered]
```
---

### **🚨 Lens 7: Red Flags & Transparency**
**Core questions:**
- Are there warning signs of misinformation?
- Is the purpose transparent?
- Are conflicts of interest disclosed?
- Does source have accountability mechanisms?

**CRITICAL Red Flags (Any one is disqualifying):**
- 🔴 Fabricated quotes or sources
- 🔴 Doctored images/videos
- 🔴 Impersonating credible sources
- 🔴 Previously debunked hoax being recycled

**SERIOUS Red Flags (Multiple = major concern):**
- 🟠 "Mainstream media won't report this" (conspiracy framing)
- 🟠 Claims "one weird trick" or miracle solution
- 🟠 Appeals to "do your own research" without providing sources
- 🟠 Urgency tactics: "Share before deleted!"
- 🟠 Absolute certainty on complex topics
- 🟠 No corrections policy or refusal to correct errors
- 🟠 Mixing ads with content without disclosure

**MODERATE Concerns:**
- 🟡 Clickbait headlines

- 🟡 Outdated information presented as current

**Transparency Indicators (Good signs):**
- ✅ Corrections/updates clearly marked
- ✅ Methodology explained
- ✅ Conflicts of interest disclosed
- ✅ Contact information provided
- ✅ Sources linked/cited
- ✅ Clear distinction between news and opinion

## 📊 SCORING BREAKDOWN

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Evidence Quality | 0/25 | No study exists; claim fabricated |
| Source Credibility | 3/25 | Anonymous account with financial motive |
| Reasoning Quality | 5/25 | Uses emotional manipulation vs. logic |
| Transparency | 10/25 | Doesn't disclose supplement sales |
| **TOTAL** | **18/100** | |

---

## ⚖️ FACT-CHECK STATUS

**Claim**: "New Harvard study proves coffee cures diabetes"
**Result**: ❌ FALSE
- No matching study in Harvard Medical School publications
- Coffee has shown modest association with reduced Type 2 diabetes 
  risk (not "cure")
- Latest research (JAMA 2024) shows 12% risk reduction with 3-5 
  cups/day—helpful but not curative

---

## 💡 WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW

**The Bottom Line**: This is fabricated clickbait designed to sell 
supplements by exploiting health concerns.

**Context You Need**: While some research shows coffee may reduce 
Type 2 diabetes risk modestly, it doesn't cure diabetes and isn't 
hidden by anyone.

**Why This Matters**: Believing this could lead diabetics to abandon 
actual treatment, causing serious harm.

---

## ✅ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

- ❌ Do not share
- Report post if on platform you use
- If diabetic friend shares this, gently correct with real research
- Block/mute @HealthGuru247 for spreading health misinformation

**Better sources on coffee & diabetes**:
- American Diabetes Association (diabetes.org)
- Recent meta-analysis: JAMA Internal Medicine (2024)
